## Walkers and Payload Examples

### 1. Set Avatar

**Walker:** `'set_avatar'`

- Uploads and sets an avatar image for the agent.
- The `files` parameter should include the image file to be set as the avatar.
- The image content needs to be base64-encoded on the backend.

#### Sample Payload
```json
{
    "agent_id": "my-agent-uuid",
    "module_root": "actions.jivas.avatar_action",
    "walker": "set_avatar",
    "args": {},
    "files": [
        {
            "name": "avatar.png",
            "content": "<binary image data>",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ]
}
```

---

### 2. Get Avatar

**Walker:** `'get_avatar'`

- Retrieves the avatar image for the agent as a base64 encoded string.
- You may specify whether to include a base64 prefix using `base64_prefix`.

#### Sample Payload
```json
{
    "agent_id": "my-agent-uuid",
    "module_root": "actions.jivas.avatar_action",
    "walker": "get_avatar",
    "args": {
        "base64_prefix": true
    },
    "files": []
}
```

---

### 3. Delete Avatar

**Walker:** `'delete_avatar'`

- Deletes the agent's avatar image.

#### Sample Payload
```json
{
    "agent_id": "my-agent-uuid",
    "module_root": "actions.jivas.avatar_action",
    "walker": "delete_avatar",
    "args": {},
    "files": []
}
```

---

## Notes

- The response structure will depend on the walker's implementation.
- For `set_avatar`, ensure the image file is properly encoded and the mimetype is correctly specified.
- For `get_avatar`, if `base64_prefix` is `True`, the returned string will include the mimetype prefix (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,`).
- Errors and status messages will be returned as part of the response.

---

### Best Practices
- Validate your API keys and model parameters before deployment.
- Test pipelines in a staging environment before production use.
